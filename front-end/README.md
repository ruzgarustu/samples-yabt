# YABT. Front-end

## Technologies
* Angular 12
* Angular Material

## Getting Started
To run it locally, you need:

1. Install the latest LTS versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
2. Open `front-end` folder and initialize the project by running `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` command.
3. Build and run by `npm start`.  -> I had to do this instead : `npx ng serve --ssl`

It will run the Angular app in a dev mode pointing to the back-end at `https://localhost:5001`.
